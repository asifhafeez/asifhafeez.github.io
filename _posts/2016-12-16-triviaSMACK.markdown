description: A Multiplayer Pub Quiz for the Amazon Alexa voice software
technologies: Java, AWS Lambda, Alexa Skills Kit, JUnit
background: Makers Academy final project built over 2 weeks
information: Working alongside my team, we developed a pub quiz game Alexa Skill in Java. Within two weeks, we had implemented all of the original features we had set out to include - multiple teams, a variety of questions, a time limit, answer verification, a score counter and a winner. <br><br> We decided to use a Amazon Web Services Lambda to host our code and run our servers because it works well with Alexa.This gave us 3 programming languages to choose from and we decided to use Java because the other two options (Python or NodeJS) were very familiar to all of us and we wanted to learn something new. We also used JUnit to test our business logic. <br><br> This was a great project because it was the first application I had built that did not have a visual representation. After focusing on web development for 10 weeks, it was nice to do something different and use a completely different language. The quality of the code is fairly low because of the time restraint we had and I would love to refactor it and encapsulate some of the functions into different classes. Furthermore, our test coverage was not as high as I wanted.
