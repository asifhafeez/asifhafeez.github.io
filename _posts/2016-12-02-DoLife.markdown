description: A Task Manager built using React and NodeJS.
technologies: ReactJS, NodeJS, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, Jest
background: Makers Academy project 
information: As a team of 4, we set out with big ambitions to create a fully functioning task manager within a week. We had never used React before and decided to use that as the front end. This proved difficult because of the steep learning curve in testing the react components. However, we managed to overcome this and by day 3, we moved on to adding a database using Node, Express and Sequelize. Again, we had never used any of these technologies before but within a day, we managed to hook up our front end app to our back end node app. <br><br> We worked very hard on this project and learnt how to use 4 (5 including Jest) completely new technologies within a week. Future functions include adding a function to filter by tags, adding users, refactoring the code and improving test coverage. However, I am very happy with the overall functionality of the app and our hard work to get it deployed within a week. <br><br> This is a project I hope to return to in the future because it is so easy to implement new features. The hard setup work we have already done means that the foundations are there to build on. Also, I enjoyed working with React and Node and would love to revisit them.
