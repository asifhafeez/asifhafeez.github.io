description: A Movie Review Website built using Ruby on Rails
technologies: Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap SASS, CSS
background: Personal tutorial project built with the help of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DR5JLZ2Qgg&list=PL23ZvcdS3XPLNdRYB_QyomQsShx59tpc-&index=5">this video</a>
information: After watching this video, I tried my hardest to replicate the site <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfWZwsP8trUy5uHJg8gcGIQ">Mackenzie Child</a> had built. This was the first Rails project I took on and it was a lot of hard work because I did not know any Ruby. As a matter of fact, I didn't know what I was doing half of the time.<br><br> I did no testing for this project. However I learnt so much that I decided to include it in my portfolio. Firstly, I saw the work that goes into creating a web application from scratch, as well as the problems that can be encountered when coding. Secondly, this project inspired me to continue my learning and eventually apply to Makers Academy. <br><br> Furthermore, I was very happy with the end result. The site includes the ability to add movies, review them, user log in, average review score and even a search function. I would really like to come back to this project and expand it further in the future, as well as fix the styling on some of the buttons and pages.
