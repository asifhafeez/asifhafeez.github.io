description: A Fully Interactable Thermostat built using Javascript and JQuery 
technologies: JavaScript, JQuery, Jasmine
background: Makers Academy Week 5 Project 
information: This was built with a succession of other people and I have to give credit to <a href="https://github.com/eunkenlow" target="_blank">Ken</a> for the way the site looks. <br><br> The reason I like this project so much is because it was the first app I built using Javascript. On Monday we were introduced to Javascript and by Friday we had this fully functioning thermostat which mimics the behaviour of a normal thermostat.<br><br> We also managed to interact properly with the weather API. As you can see, when using the drop down menu to change cities you receive the weather for that particular city. The weather icon also changes. I was very proud of managing to achieve this within a week because the weather API was the first API I ever dealt with.<br><br> Furthermore, the backend logic is well organised and the entire app was well tested using Jasmine.
